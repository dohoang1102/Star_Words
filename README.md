Star Words:  May The Quote Be With You
======================================
Developed for the iPhone - November, 2011


What is Star Words?
---------------------
Star Words is the first game I created for the iOS platform.  It was the final project I submitted for a Mobile Application Development class taken at DePaul University.

Star Words is a combination of a trivia and word scramble game designed to test the users knowledge of the Star Wars movies. Users are provided with a clue about the quote in question. Then, they are provided with a number of different words to choose from to build the correct quote that supports the clue.
